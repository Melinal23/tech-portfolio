**Description**

Interactive fiction game developed using Inform7.

You are at one of your soccer games, which has 5 minutes left on the clock, thus inducing high stress and nervousness from you. You are on the field waiting for the ball to be passed to you when all of a sudden you find yourself in a world unknown to you. When you wake up in this world you lack memory of what happened, who you are, and other memories. It is your mission to recover three lost memories in order to fully remember what occurred and get back to your life.

**Description**

Developed with a team using Unity 2D and C#.

One evening by the fire, grandpa is telling you the story of farmers. Your purpose… your mission… as farmers is to save good plants and allow them to prosper in farms.

In a world where mutated plants are endangering lives everywhere, it is up to you, the brave farmer, to save the saplings that have not yet turned and bring them back to the farm to nurture. 

My contributions: Title Screen, Home Scene, Level 2, pause menu, Patrolling Plant enemy, playerController script, and player animations.
