##The Psyche Journey

#Description:

Interactive fiction game developed using Inform 7.

The purpose of The Psyche Journey is to take the player on an adventure through the human psyche as Sigmond Freud defines it. Hence the majority of the gameplay takes place in a region called The Mind which has four rooms: the Id, the Ego, the Superego, and the Conscious. The game begins with the player at one of their soccer games being in a huddle with their team with their coach encouraging them that they have a chance to win even though they are currently losing and there are only 5 minutes left on the clock. The player is thus visibly nervous about being able to perform their best to pull a win for his/her team with 5 minutes left on the clock. Then the player is on the soccer field in position waiting for one of his/her teammates to kick the ball to them. When their teammate does kick the ball they kick it so hard that the ball comes hurtling towards the player’s head and it hits the player so hard that the player becomes unconscious (although this is not told to the player directly, they have to infer that the ball caused them to become unconscious by realizing that they go from the soccer field to the Conscious in the mind). Once in the mind, more specifically the Conscious, the player realizes that they can’t recall important information about him/herself. Thus, the player is tasked with exploring the parts/rooms of the mind in order to find and collect three memories that they then are hinted into putting into a glass case in the Conscious. The Id, Superego, and Ego rooms were modeled to reflect what that part of the mind stands for. For example, the Id is known to be where humans hold their desires and temptations, thus the enemy in this room is Eros who is known as the Greek god of physical desires. The Superego is known to be where one can find are ideal and morals, thus I placed a balancing scale in this room to symbolize a balancing of morals and justice. Furthermore, the second enemy of the game, the player’s Mom, is placing here to question the player’s ideals and morals by scolding the player for prioritizing their sport more than their grades. Lastly, the Ego is known to be the rational part of the mind, thus I modeled the room after the player’s bedroom so that the room is familiar to the player and thus makes sense. In addition, I placed the player’s real-life friend, Kevin, in this room to provide a rational solution to the player’s Mom’s scolding. Once all three memories are collected and placed in the glass case, the player is transported to another region called The End and they find themselves in a room called the Hospital where they are told they are laying in a hospital bed surrounded by friends and family (some they saw in their mind).
