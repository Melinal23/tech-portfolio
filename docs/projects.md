Interactive fiction game developed using Inform7.

You are at one of your soccer games, which has 5 minutes left on the clock, thus inducing high stress and nervousness from you. You are on the field waiting for the ball to be passed to you when all of a sudden you find yourself in a world unknown to you. When you wake up in this world you lack memory of what happened, who you are, and other memories. It is your mission to recover three lost memories in order to fully remember what occurred and get back to your life.

**Description**

Developed with a partner using Greenfoot and Java.

Trembly is a timid and fearful turtle who hides in his shell when he encounters a scary situation or needs protection. Not only that, but Trembly is extremely selfless and helpful, so much, that he is willing to face his fears to help other animals in need. This makes him brave. 

In the first level, the selfless turtle, Trembly, meets a mama bird who lost her egg. She is in desperation because she cannot go find the egg herself since she needs to stay at the nest to guard it. Therefore, she kindly asks Trembly if he would go looking for and retrieve her egg for her. Trembly is hesitant because he doesn’t like exploring new and uncertain territories and is scared of heights and falling, but he realizes that if he doesn’t help mama bird, her egg will be lost forever... and so the journey begins!

Responsibilites: Finding the visuals for the game, including backgrounds, music, sound effects, and some NPC. Trembly’s collision detection with enemies and other harmful objects. Designing the layout of Level 3. Implemented Trembly’s health "bar".
